# Redmine Worktime Log Plugin
Release Candidate: 0.0.2

### Inception
Hey folks.

If describe this plugin in couple words - Worktime Log is just a Stopwatch plugin with extended projects / users / issues summary. I'm pretty sure that plugin will help you track your team load without any additional inconvenience editing issue details and billion clicks.

Worktime Log built about 3 month ago for internal use and today I decided to share firs public RC with you. 

In general plugin created and tested with Redmine 2.6 under PostgreSQL, by this reason some queries should be reviewed before push to production with MySQL database.

Feel free to make forks and touch me in case if you have some fixes and suggestions.

### How it works?
1. Enable Worktime Log module in your project
2. Add couple tickets assigned to you
3. Push START button and continue working
4. Don't forget press STOP when you going on lunch :)

### Extra Issue Toolbar
To make life easier I have added additional toolbar to issue overview. In case if you don't need this tool you may change toolbar visibility inside plugin settings.
