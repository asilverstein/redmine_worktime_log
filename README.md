# Redmine Worktime Log Plugin
Release Candidate: 0.0.1

### Inception
Hey folks.

If one work Worktime Log is just a Stopwatch plugin with extended projects / users / issues summary. I'm pretty sure that plugin will help you track your team load without any additional inconvenience editing issue details and billion clicks.

Worktime Log built about 3 month ago and today I completely added missing things to prepare first RC. 

Plugin built for internal use for Redmine and PostgreSQL, by this reason some queries should be reviewed before push to production with MySQL database.

Feel free to make forks and touch me in case if you have some fixes and suggestions.

### How it works?
Push START button and continue working and don't forget to press STOP when you going on lunch :)

### Installation
1. Copy plugin files to ```/redmine/plugins``` and you will get something like that: ```redmine/plugins/redmine_worktime_log/init.rb```
2. Run ```rake redmine:plugins NAME=redmine_worktime_log RAILS_ENV=production```
